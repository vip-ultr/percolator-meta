# Percolator Meta

A Solana program that bootstraps a Percolator market and distributes the initial COIN supply through a **Sybil-resistant governance vote**.

Depositing capital is purely a Sybil check, not an investment. Participants put principal **at risk** in the bootstrap market for one reason — to earn the right to vote on the COIN distribution. There is **no financial reward**: no yield and no profit share. The capital *is* custodied by the program — it is transferred into program-owned vaults and deployed into the market, and can only be withdrawn back out through the program — but the rules are fixed and non-discretionary: no party can divert depositor principal (governance may draw only genuine *surplus* above it), and depositors recover their principal (pro-rata against recoverable funds if the market lost money). The capital at risk *is* the cost of voting, which is what makes votes expensive to Sybil.

The winning COIN distribution becomes the **MetaDAO**: the new COIN is its token, and it inherits the program's keys (via the Squads handover) along with any surplus.

This is research/educational code, not financial advice and not a guarantee of correctness or fitness for any purpose. Genesis participants put real capital **at risk** in a live market and can lose it — the deposit is a Sybil-resistance bond, not an investment. Use at your own risk.

## Genesis Plan

1. MetaDAO initializes `CoinConfig` with a configurable bootstrap delay in slots. A zero delay is live immediately; the intended launch setting can be a six-month slot delay.
2. Futarchy creates `GenesisConfig` with a fixed COIN reward supply.
3. Anyone may join at any time during the deposit phase — there is no fixed window — by depositing base units into `genesis_vault`; additional deposits are allowed. Each deposit (re)sets the position's `start_slot` to the current slot (last-write-time), so topping up late resets the clock. Deposits close when futarchy deploys the pool at kickstart.
4. **Depositing is a Sybil check, not an investment.** The capital is put at risk in the bootstrap market for one purpose: to earn voting power over the COIN distribution. Depositors receive no yield and no profit share — committed capital-at-risk is simply the cost of a vote.
5. Futarchy kickstarts the Percolator market with the pooled capital as a 50/50 split (`floor(total / 2)` to insurance, the remainder to backing), and sets a capital-protected withdraw policy (`max_bps=10000, deposits_only=1, cooldown=0`) so principal — never market profits — is recoverable.
6. **Withdraw any time; holding is what counts.** A capital provider may withdraw their principal at any point — there is no lock-up. Withdrawal returns principal (pro-rata against recoverable funds if the market lost money, since they bear the market risk) and **forfeits the vote**. A non-voter exits freely whenever they like; a depositor backing a proposal must first **retract** their ballot (which backs their weight and principal out of that proposal's tally) so a vote can never outlive the capital that backed it. As people leave, the quorum denominator (outstanding principal) shrinks with them — quorum is recomputed against whoever is still committed.
7. **One vote, one proposal.** Anyone may register a candidate distribution; each depositor backs exactly one with their stake (re-voting moves it). Vote weight is time-weighted: `floor(log2(hold_time)) × principal`, resolved at vote time. Earlier/longer holders weigh more, and there is no weight without time committed at risk.
8. **Permissionless winner-take-all trigger.** The vote is the authority, so executing it needs no governance signer. Anyone may trigger a proposal once quorum is valid (`total_voted_principal × 2 > outstanding`) **and** it holds a strict majority of the cast log-weight (`support_weight × 2 > total_cast_weight`). The first valid trigger mints **100% of the fixed COIN supply** to that proposal's destination and ends the decision — winner-take-all. Triggering requires a kickstarted market, so COIN can never be issued on a genesis whose capital was never deployed. The discretionary governance mint (`mint_reward`) is locked until genesis is finalized, so the winner's fixed supply cannot be diluted while depositors are voting; post-finalization (MetaDAO in control) it is open for ongoing rewards.
9. Finalization requires a kicked market and `minted_supply == reward_supply` (i.e. a proposal has been triggered); it remains a thin governance step that sequences the principal recovery before withdrawals switch to the haircut path.
10. The triggered distribution's COIN **is** the MetaDAO token. Control of the market and its keys transfers to the MetaDAO through the Squads handover.

Any surplus (value in `genesis_vault` above outstanding principal) belongs to the MetaDAO, drawn through the keys it inherits — the program itself pays out only principal.

**Operational invariant:** futarchy must `kickstart_genesis_market` before (or together with) `activate_live`. Minting and finalization both require a kicked market, so going live without kickstarting can never issue COIN — and because there is no withdrawal lock, depositors can still exit (non-voters directly, voters after retracting), so capital is never stranded. The kickstart-before-live ordering itself remains a governance responsibility.

## Post-Genesis Lifecycle

After `activate_live`, anyone may create additional Percolator markets through `init_percolator_market`. The caller funds the market account, but the COIN-specific `percolator_market_admin` PDA becomes Percolator admin.

Futarchy controls the market lifecycle through explicit meta-program instructions:

- Percolator market init, asset lifecycle, oracle setup, fee policy, resolve, and close-slab cleanup.
- Builder-code approvals by `(coin_mint, builder_program, code_hash)` plus a terms hash.

Raw Percolator `UpdateAuthority` and funding/withdrawal tags are not exposed through the generic admin proxy. Custody-bearing authority changes must use explicit setup paths.

Cranks and permissionless Percolator maintenance remain external.

## Capital Accounting

There is **no yield-bearing deposit product** anywhere in this program. All deposited capital is a Sybil bond: at risk in the bootstrap market, recoverable on withdrawal (pro-rata under loss, since depositors bear the market risk), and earning only voting power — never a financial return. The program custodies the capital (it is transferred into program-owned vaults and deployed into the market, and is only withdrawable through the program), but no party can divert depositor principal: the program pays principal back, and only genuine surplus (value above outstanding principal) is the MetaDAO's, drawn through the keys it inherits.

After genesis, ongoing insurance/backing capital for the market is the MetaDAO's responsibility — funded from its treasury and surplus through the keys it holds — not from external depositors earning yield.

## Tested Surface

The LiteSVM suite runs against the real percolator, governance, rewards, and Squads v4 binaries. A single end-to-end test (`test_full_genesis_to_dao_lifecycle_end_to_end`) chains the entire lifecycle with no shortcuts: deposit → real market init → Squads 1/1+48h creation → real 50/50 kickstart → mid-bootstrap depositor exit pulling principal back from the live market → go live → propose/vote/mint 100% of supply → recover market principal → finalize → hand the Squads config-authority to the winning DAO → remaining depositors withdraw. Individual phases are also covered in isolation:

- Configurable bootstrap delay, open-ended deposit phase, and live activation.
- Genesis deposit, vote, 100% supply mint, finalize, withdrawal, surplus, recovery, and 50/50 kickstart.
- Withdraw at any time: principal back from the vault before kickstart and pulled pro-rata from the live market after; non-voters exit freely, voters must retract their ballots first, and the quorum denominator recomputes as people leave — so a vote counts only if held through the final slot.
- Time-weighted votes: `floor(log2(hold_time)) × principal` rewards earlier/longer holders, last-write-time `start_slot` reset on re-deposit, one vote per voter to one proposal, and permissionless winner-take-all triggering (a proposal needs a strict majority of cast weight plus a principal quorum; exactly-half fails both).
- Permissionless market creation plus futarchy-controlled Percolator lifecycle/admin operations.
- Builder approvals and executable-program validation.
- Genesis→DAO Squads handover: program-created 1/1 + 48h multisig and config-authority rotation, driven through governance against the real mainnet Squads binary, plus a standalone harness proving timelock enforcement and upgrade-key rotation (`program/tests/squads_handover.rs`).
- Disabled legacy staking/reward-pool instruction tags.

Current full-suite smoke target:

```bash
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path governance/Cargo.toml
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path program/Cargo.toml
RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608 cargo test --manifest-path program/Cargo.toml --test integration
```

The integration test also requires a built Percolator BPF binary at `../percolator-prog/target/deploy/percolator_prog.so`.

Tags `0`–`2`, `4`–`7`, `9`, and the former risk-vault slots `12`–`18` are intentionally disabled: there is no yield-bearing deposit product, so the insurance/backing risk-vault accounting (`init_risk_vault`, `risk_deposit`, `risk_withdraw`, `sync_risk_vault`, `risk_claim_rewards`, …) is removed.

## Squads Handover

The genesis market's governance is held by a program-created [Squads v4](https://squads.so) multisig: a controlled 1/1 multisig with a 48-hour timelock whose `config_authority` is this program's `percolator_market_admin` PDA from genesis (`init_genesis_squads`). The multisig address is deterministic per coin (create-key seed `[b"genesis_squads", coin_mint]`).

Control transfers to the winning genesis DAO by rotating that `config_authority` (`handover_genesis_squads`, permitted only once genesis is finalized). Percolator's own `UpdateAuthority` is never touched, so no incoming-authority consent is required and depositor custody is never re-pointed. Both instructions are reached through the governance adapter (tags `17`/`18`).
